Microsimulation-of-Coronary-Heart-Disease-CHD-Incidence-and-Mortality-rate
This microsimulation models the long-term health outcomes of a synthetic population over 30 years, specifically focusing on Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) incidence and mortality. Each individual in the population is assigned sociodemographic characteristics such as age, sex, and risk factors like BMI, systolic blood pressure (SBP), smoking, and alcohol consumption. The simulation dynamically updates these characteristics annually, recalculating the risk of developing CHD based on the individual’s evolving profile. Mortality risk is also assessed, influenced by both disease incidence and other factors. The model tracks the population’s health states over time, simulating disease progression and mortality events, while storing annual results for further analysis. This approach enables the study of the long-term effects of risk factor changes and disease incidence on population health, offering insights into potential interventions or policy changes aimed at reducing disease burden.
